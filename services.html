                    <h2>Adult Eye Exams</h2>
                    <p>Many people feel if they see well, they don't need an eye exam. The truth is that many eye diseases that eventually lead to blindness have no early symptoms to let you know something is wrong. So even if you see '20/20', you will still benefit from a thorough eye exam every 12-24 months. Our adult eye exam covers your vision as well as your eye health. If problems are detected, early treatment may keep you seeing well for the rest of your life. So, don't take any chances with your eyes when about an hour of your time every year or two is all that is needed!</p>

                    <h2>Eye Exams for Children</h2>
                    <p>We can't express enough how important it is to have your child's eye development examined by an eye doctor. The recommended age of your child's first exam is between the ages of 6 months and 2 years old. Birth to 6 years old is a critical period of eye development. At that time, your child's eyes are forming connections in the brain which will determine how well your child sees for the rest of his/her life. If there are any problems with an eye turning or blurred vision in one eye, the brain will shut that eye off. If not found before the age of 5, there is a good chance your child may never see well with that eye no matter what is done after that. The best news we can give you is that your child's eyes are developing normally. It's a great feeling to know that your child has the vision skills required to do well when he/she starts school.

                    <h2>Diagnosis/Treatment for Eye Diseases</h2>
                        <p>Our doctors are skilled at diagnosing and treating many eye diseases. We love educating patients about their eye health and discussing what they can do to be a part of it. Sometimes that requires a referral to a specialist in a certain area such as retinology, oculoplastics, neurology, cardiology or endocrinology just to name a few. It may also require further specialized testing such as a threshold visual field, nerve fiber analysis, blood sugar analysis, CT-scan or MRI for example. You can be rest assured that we will use the full range of our expertise, experience and resources to find an answer to your questions.</p>

                    <h2>Dry Eye</h2>
                    <p>There have been some great advances in the area of dry eye over the past few years. We will help you find the best combination of treatment which may include punctal plugs, fish oil supplements, prescription eye drops, and IPL (Intense Pulse Light) therapy. IPL is a new treatment that helps improve the function of oil glands in the eyelid to help lubricate the eye. Another treatment option is Lipiflow, which uses an activator to apply heat to the inner eyelid.</p>

                    <h2>Macula Risk&reg; Genetic Testing</h2>
                    <p>Combined with a routine clinical eye examination, results of the Macula Risk test determine which patients are at the highest risk of vision loss from Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Macula Risk involves a simple cheek swab that is covered by most insurers for patients with a diagnosis of early or intermediate AMD.

                    <p>You may also want to be evaluated and fit with contact lenses. Since our doctors keep up with the latest developments in contact lens designs, we can provide you with the most up-to-date contacts on the market today. First time patients with us will pay a little more for the contact lens evaluation and fitting process since it's more involved. Our previous patients in contacts that have been fit by us will enjoy a price reduction on the fitting/evaluation because the bulk of the process has already been accomplished. Why pay the same price if it requires less time and effort on our part?</p>
